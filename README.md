# Coaches

Being here automatically qualifies you to be a coach on Stacks [germanstack]. We await your awesomeness with the contributions you make to the community and developer advocacy. 

## Coaches onboarding Process 
Before engaging with Stacks as a coach: 

- An individual should understand that courses on stacks are not paid for, therefore; the service rendered is considered to be open source and our contributions to the project and its stability.

- An individual should understand the commitment of availability of every weekend for the next 6 months. 

- An individual should understand the importance of inclusivity to the community irrespective of religion, belief, cultures, race and all other factors. 

- An individual should understand the importance of staying true to themselves and their commitment to uphold the [COC](https://github.com/germanstack/coaches/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) adopted by Stacks. 


If you fully agree to the conditions above this automatically means you are legally bonded to this contributors’ covenant. Fill the form [here](https://goo.gl/forms/ACtFziaeX5pnU9mg2) and return for the onboarding vetting process. 

## Onboarding Process

To ensure our contents (docs, articles, and codes) stay fresh, coaching slots are always open at the end of every cohort (6 months) and old contents will be moved to the LEGACY site for folks from previous cohorts wishing to go through the contents over again. If at the time of reading this document a cohort is already on, don’t worry you will be the first to know when a cohort ends and you can go ahead to fire up that awesome PR.

**To get started with onboarding, you are one PR far from being a coach:**

- Open a PR [here](https://github.com/germanstack/german-docs/tree/master/src/pages) with the name of the article in the course you wish to contribute to. Please, ensure there’s no existing topic similar to what you have to contribute. See [AVALIABLE_TOPICS.MD](https://github.com/germanstack/coaches/blob/master/AVAILABLE_TOPICS.md) sort for something unique. A PR can be based on How-to(s) or a Framework, or even a Technology.

- Modifications can be done to an existing topic but can only be merged by the original author of the article, this is considered as co-authoring. 

- If your PR gets merged to master and deployed? You are officially welcomed to being a Stacks coach for the cohort.

- To fully complete the process and to add your name and image to stack’s webpage open a PR with the name and social details in webpage repo.
